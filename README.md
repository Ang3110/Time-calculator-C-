# Time Calculator (C++)

Welcome to the **Time Calculator** project, a **C++** program that allows users to input time in various units (such as seconds, minutes, hours) and convert them into other units. The program supports both basic arithmetic operations and more complex mathematical expressions, making it a versatile tool for time conversions.

This project uses the [exprtk](https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk) library for evaluating mathematical expressions. Special thanks to Arash Partow for this powerful library.


## Features

- Convert between various time units: seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years.
- Support for arithmetic expressions (e.g., `6 * 2`, `(60 + 120) / 2`).
- Easily input and evaluate complex expressions for time units.
- Rounds float inputs to the nearest whole number when converting between units.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the program, you'll need the following:

- A C++ compiler such as **GCC** or **Clang** (for Linux/macOS) or **MinGW** (for Windows).
- Ensure that your compiler supports **C++11** or later.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

You can clone or download the repository to your local machine by using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ang3110/Time-calculator-CPP.git
```
After cloning the project, navigate to the project's directory and compile the `time_calc.cpp` file. The compilation process may take around 20 seconds. Once compiled, launch the program by running `./time_calc`. Enjoy!
